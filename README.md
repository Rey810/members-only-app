#In this project, I’ll implement an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

In this app I roll out my own authentication system. It's built in Rails in partial completion of The Odin Project.
